		  <h1>Trivia Hunt</h1>
		  <p>Explore new places and answer puzzling trivia questions in a "Choose Your Own Adventure" type game.</p>
		  <br>
		  <h2>How to Play</h2>
		  <p>As you explore the area around you, the game will show you two places on the map where you need to go and "check-in".  A check-in will award you 10 points.  Once you arrive at that location you will be prompted with a trivia question.  If you answer the question correctly, you will get 50 points and then be given two new places to go.  If you answer the question wrong, you lose 30 points and only get one new place to go to.  You can also redeem yourself and get 50 points by creating a new trivia question.  All scores are logged on the Leaderboard and are upadated as the game is played.  So gather some of your friends and start playing today!</p>
